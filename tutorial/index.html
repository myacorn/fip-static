                    <h6>Tutorial</h6>
                    <p>
                        This tutorial was designed to give new users a quick introduction to the Fisheries
                        Information Platform. The tutorial is arranged into five sections, each tackling
                        the different components and tools available in the FIP. You can select the section
                        you want to view although we recommend for you to work on the sections
                        sequentially. It takes about 15 minutes to go through the entire tutorial.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We first discuss briefly the datasets used in the platform. Section 1 of the
                        tutorial focuses on the general configuration of the FIP, and then we dive
                        into the details. Section 2 explains the main menu, and concepts such as
                        adding layers, turning layers on and off and layer ordering. Section 3 explains
                        how to search along the map. Section 4 discusses how to use the toolbar to print
                        your map, import layers and perform measurements. Finally, Section 5 dives into
                        how to use the GIS toolbar. Here you will find novel tools to extract quantitative
                        information out of the platform.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The FIP was developed using MapStore, an open source WebGIS framework developed to
                        create, manage and share maps. If you are familiar with MapStore, you can surely skip
                        most of this tutorial, just have a look at Section 5 for information on some special
                        tools that were created specifically for this project.

                                The FIP includes fisheries data for the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) Fisheries
                                Management area, which covers the entire US EEZ from the Atlantic
                                Mexico border up to the Florida Keys. The Platform contains
                                non-confidential data of fishing landings and revenues for shrimp,
                                reef fish, highly migratory species and recreational headboat
                                fisheries in the GoM. Details of the fisheries datasets can be found
                                following <b><a href="/methodological-details.html">this link</a></b>.

                                Additional datasets have been included to provide context to the
                                fisheries data, including marine jurisdictions, oil and gas pipelines
                                and structures, shipping and navigation routes, areas with spatial
                                management and sea surface temperature.

                                The default map view displays several basic features. (1) The
                                <strong>Main menu</strong> is on the left, where an expandable
                                window has information on the map layers. (2) The 
                                <strong>Search bar</strong> on the top allows you to search within
                                the map. (3) On the top right you have a <strong>Toolbar</strong>
                                with a series ofspecialized tools. (4) On the bottom right you have
                                a bar with <strong>GIS tools</strong> to navigate the map and
                                extract information. We will go through these in detail below, but
                                getting around the FIP is easy: you’ll have pointers letting you
                                know what each tool does if you hover (move the mouse) over the
                                relevant icon.

                                You can <strong>Toggle the visibility of the group</strong>
                                of layers or <strong>Toggle the visibility of individual layers</strong>
                                by clicking on the eye icon. If you would rather change the order of the
                                layers to make the layer(s) of interest more prominent you can
                                <strong>Grab and sort the layer or the group:</strong> just click on
                                the three lines and drag the item up or down the list to its desired
                                position. For each layer, you can Adjust the transparency by sliding
                                the bar left or right so multiple layers will be visible on top of each
                                other. Finally, if you click on the chevron, you’ll be able to
                                <strong>Display the legend</strong> for that layer.

                                You can explore all layers contained in the FIP by scrolling through
                                the window. Currently (as June 2024) the platform’s data main
                                categories are: Reef fish fisheries, Shrimp fisheries, Pelagic
                                fisheries, Other fisheries, and Other data. Each category comes with
                                an associated group of layers. You can <strong>Open a group</strong>
                                of layers to see their content by clicking on the folder icon.
                                Alternatively, you can <strong>Close a group</strong> by clicking on
                                the open folder icon. Finally, you can search all the layers by using
                                the <strong>Filter layers</strong> box. For example, searching by
                                “Florida” will list all layers depicting data for Florida for the
                                entire dataset.

                                The search bar allows you to find a site of interest in the map, either by specifying an address
                                (towns, streets, or post codes) or coordinates in decimal degrees. The default is to query by
                                address. The FIP will autocomplete your text if you’re typing a street address and then zoom into
                                that location. If you want to search by coordinate instead, click on
                                <strong>Change the search tool</strong> and you’ll be able to search by coordinates instead using
                                decimal degrees. Remember you can always go back to a larger extent by using the
                                <strong>GIS toolbar</strong>.

                                the current map, <strong>Import a map file</strong> or vector data to add to your map and

                                You can print the current view for later use. Simply enter a
                                <strong>Title</strong> and a <strong>Description</strong> of your map
                                and indicate what file <strong>Format</strong> you need. You can choose
                                between PDF, PNG or JPEG. <strong>Rotate</strong> the map if it makes
                                more sense to have it at an angle for interpretation. You can also
                                decide on the <strong>Layout</strong> of the map: what
                                <strong>Size of Sheet</strong> you’re printing off, if you want to
                                include the <strong>Legend</strong>, and if you would like the sheet
                                to be printed on <strong>Landscape</strong> (horizontal) or
                                <strong>Portrait</strong> (vertical) format. For maps encompassing the
                                entire Gulf of Mexico, landscape is better. You can also decide on the
                                output <strong>Resolution</strong> of the map (the larger the value the
                                more detail but also the larger the output file). Click
                                <strong>Print</strong>. You can zoom in and out of the final map to see
                                the details. If you would like some changes, go back. If you are happy
                                with how it looks, click the download button, the one with the down
                                arrow.

                                analysis. This tool supports the vector formats Shapefiles, KML, KMZ
                                or GeoJSON. If you have a Shapefile you need to first compress all
                                files within a zip folder. Simply select the file you want to upload
                                or drop it into the window. The new data will appear on the main menu,
                                under the group “Default” at the very top.

                                You can customize the new feature by selecting the color of the stroke
                                and its width, as well as the color of the fill. If you click
                                <strong>Finish</strong>, then your feature will appear, and the view
                                will automatically zoom into that feature in the map unless you
                                unclick <strong>Zoom on the vector files</strong>. The new feature

                                <br>
                                You can measure <strong>distance</strong>, <strong>area</strong> and
                                <strong>bearing</strong> on the map using different
                                </strong>measurement units</strong>. To measure a distance, click on
                                the <strong>distance</strong> icon and then click on the map to draw
                                the beginning of your line and the nodes between sequential lines.
                                If you double click you’ll finish your line drawing. You’ll be able to
                                see both the measurements of each segment and the total length of your
                                line in the selected <strong>units</strong>. To measure an
                                <strong>area</strong> the procedure is similar: click on the map to
                                draw the vertices of your polygon, and double click to end your
                                drawing. <strong>Bearing</strong> measurements are more unusual, they
                                allow you to measure angles in degrees. To calculate a bearing, first
                                click on the map to define a starting point and then click again to
                                draw the end point. Bearings are written as a meridian, an angle and a
                                direction. For example, a bearing of S 60 W defines an angle of 60
                                degrees West measured from South.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                After you are done you can <strong>clear all your measurements</strong>
                                from the map or </strong>export them in GeoJSON format</strong> to add
                                them to the FIP later or used them in another application.

                                The GIS toolbar contains several tools to allow you to interact with
                                the map. You can <strong>Zoom in</strong> and <strong>Zoom out</strong>
                                of the map. If you’re not happy with the new extent, you can
                                <strong>Zoom to the map extent</strong> to go back to the initial view.

                                This toolbar also offers the most exciting capabilities of the FIP,
                                such as the ability to produce queries and quantitative reports.

                                (outlined in blue). The fishing territory for the reef fishery will
                                appear in blue, and for the shrimp fishery in red. These layers may
                                be better viewed with no layers on the background. If you click on the
                                county again the territories will disappear from the map.

                                a box will open showing the associated information for all fisheries.
                                You can download the information as a csv file if you would want to keep
                                it.

                                all the landings and revenues accrued by that region.  You can download the information as a csv
                                file if you would want to keep it.

                                the “Import vector data” tool (see Section 4.2 above). This will generate a report with all the
