                    <p>The Fisheries Information Platform (FIP) contains non-confidential data of fishing landings
                        and revenues for shrimp, reef fish, highly migratory species and headboat fisheries in the
                        Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Data are provided as total or summarized by time period, species or
                        GoM State.</p>
                    <p>Below we provide a brief description of the data available for each fishery, and give an
                        overview of how we dealt with data confidentiality.</p>

                            <p class="opened-for-codepen">Shrimp fisheries data were derived from electronic logbooks
                                and
                                dealer records for the period 2014-2021. Landings and revenues are reported per trip and
                                were matched to multiple VMS fishing pings. Fishing pings were identified using speed
                                filters and logic rules. Dealer records provide trip-level landings. Landings and
                                revenues
                                for each electronic logbook ping were calculated by distributing trip-level values
                                uniformly
                                to each fishing ping, the most common method used in marine spatial planning (Chollett
                                et
                                al. 2022). Unmatched revenues and landings (corresponding to fishing activity carried
                                out
                                by vessels without transponders, or when transponders were off) were distributed evenly
                                among fishing pings for that year. All revenue data were reported in 2021 dollars using
                                the
                                implicit price deflator by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Full information for

                                mapped
                                over a 10x10 km grid and over Coastal Fisheries statistical areas (Atkinson et al.

                            <p>Reef fish fisheries data are available from 2007 to 2021. In the GoM
                                reef fish are fished using multiple gears: bottom longline, handlines and bandit reels,
                                diving, buoys, gillnets, trolling, cast nets and traps. Only bottom longline, handlines
                                and
                                bandit reels have been mapped at high spatial resolution using Vessel Monitoring System
                                (VMS) data that have been linked to logbooks. Spatial information for the other
                                fisheries is
                                only available at the spatial scale of Coastal Fisheries statistical areas (Atkinson et
                                al.
                                2021), through self-reported fishing locations in logbooks.</p>
                            <p>Data for reef fish fisheries using bottom longlines, handlines and bandit reels were
                                mapped in the FIP using VMS positions that have been linked to logbook data to extract
                                landings and revenues. Fishing pings were identified using a supervised classification
                                method implemented in Random Forests (Breiman 2001). Landings and revenues are
                                reported per trip and were matched to multiple VMS fishing pings. Landings and revenues
                                for each VMS ping were calculated by distributing trip-level values uniformly to each
                                fishing ping. Unmatched revenues and landings were distributed evenly among fishing
                                pings for that year. All revenue data were reported in 2021 dollars using the implicit
                                price
                                deflator by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. This dataset was first described by
                                O’Farrell et al. (2017) and is fully described in O’Farrell et al. (in press). Bottom
                                longline,
                                handline and bandit reel reef fish fisheries data were mapped over a 10 x10 km grid and
                                over Coastal Fisheries statistical areas (Atkinson et al. 2021).</p>
                            <p>Data for reef fish fisheries without linked positional data (caught using diving, buoys,
                                gillnets and trolling) were mapped in the FIP using the self-reported Coastal Fisheries
                                statistical areas available in the logbooks (Atkinson et al. 2021). Revenues have been
                                adjusted to 2021 dollars using the implicit price deflator by the U.S. Bureau of

                            <p>Highly migratory species (HMS) are fished using
                                multiple gears: pelagic longline, bandit, bottom longline, buoys, gillnet, green stick
                                tuna,
                                handlines, ottertrawl, pairtrawl, and rod and reel, but pelagic longline is by far the
                                largest
                                fishery in the GoM, accumulating almost 90% of logbook records from 2013 to 2021.</p>
                            <p>HMS fisheries data caught using pelagic longlines are available in the FIP from 2015 to
                                2021, when revenues data are available. Total revenue estimates were calculated by
                                George Silva (NOAA’s NMFS), and are not available for specific species or species
                                groups. For this dataset, landings and revenues are reported per set and coincide with a
                                self-reported coordinate. We summarized total landings and revenues data into Coastal
                                Fisheries statistical areas (Atkinson et al. 2021). Revenues have been adjusted to 2021
                                dollars using the implicit price deflator by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.
                                Although
                                this fishery has been recently mapped using high-spatial resolution VMS data, the data

                                the fishery in the GoM is too sparse and 10 x10 km grids would involve loosing about

                            <p>In the Gulf, information for headboats targeting reef fish is available
                                from 2015 to 2021. In headboats recreational fishers carry more than six passengers for
                                half or full day trips and fishers pay by the “head” (Fitzpatrick et al. 2017). Data
                                have
                                been

                                Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SFSC) since 1986, with an electronic logbook
                                system since 2013 and economic data added in 2014 (Carter and Liese 2017, Fitzpatrick
                                et al. 2017). For each trip, logbooks collect information on date and duration of the
                                trip,
                                geographic location of fishing activity, number of individuals of each caught species

                                and price paid per gallon of fuel, among others (Fitzpatrick et al. 2017). For this

                                only data on location, date and net revenue pr trip were provided, and therefore there

                                no associated landings, species or port information.</p>
                            <p>Revenue was estimated by NOAA’s SFSC (Social Science Research Group, Recreational
                                Fisheries) as the price per angler hour multiplied by the number of anglers and trip
                                hours.
                                Net revenue was estimated as the revenue obtained minus fuel and crew costs, with fuel
                                costs equalling gallons used multiplied by the price per gallon, and crew costs
                                calculated
                                as trip duration multiplied by wage per hour and number of crew. All information was
                                extracted from logbooks except the price per angler hour and wage which were estimated
                                from additional documentation<sup>1</sup></p>
                            <p>In the FIP all revenue data were reported in 2021 dollars using the implicit price

                                density of the data the less data loss. We quantified the percentage of data removed due
                                to applying the rule of three in each layer included in the FIP. All values can be found
                                in
                                the

                            <p>Figure 1. In the figure, a grid overlays hypothetical fishing pings. Fishing pings have
                                different colors to represent different vessels. The same set of pings is shown in each
                                panel. When producing a grid and applying the rule of three, some cells and fishing
                                pings
                                are lost (right). For this hypothetical dataset, 11% of the pings are lost due to the
                                rule
                                of

                    <h6>Fishing territories</h6>
                    <p>Although the sea can look like an open landscape without boundaries, fishers' extraction of its resources is highly clustered in space, and different fishing communities have well defined fishing territories they target. Knowledge of fishing territories can be used to identify where fishing occurs, to quantify site fidelity, competition, temporal shifts in use, to assess the effects of management measures, and to allow rapid-response assessments of vulnerability of fishing-dependent communities to environmental shocks.</p>
                    <p>Fishing territories were estimated from detailed Vessel Monitoring System data that provides the position of each vessel at intervals of about 1 hour, which has been linked to logbook records recording associated counties of landing. Here, territories are identified at the spatial resolution of Counties.</p>
                    <p>Fishing territories were delineated using polygons that outline the areas where 95% of that community’s vessel activity occur in their entire fishing history.</p>
                    <p>For reef fishing (longline, handline and bandit reel), territories span the period 2007-2021. The maps were created using a Local Convex Hull method that constructs small minimum convex polygons (hulls) for each fishing position and its neighbors, and then merging the hulls together, therefore taking spatial autocorrelation into account (Getz et al. 2007). Here, we set the parameter k (the number of neighbors) to the square root of the number of observations, which is commonly advised (Signer et al. 2015, Noonan et al. 2019). This method has shown to be the most appropriate to estimate fishing territories in fishing data (Chollett et al, in review).</p>
                    <p>For shrimp, territories describe the fishery for the period 2014-2021. The maps were created using a Kernel Density Estimation method that aggregates all fishing effort into grids, and then generates a surface using a non-parametric method based on a smoothing parameter h. Kernel results are extremely sensitive to the choice of the smoothing parameter.  Here, we used the automatic method smoothed cross validation (Duong 2022) to calculate a bivariate h. This method has shown to be appropriate to estimate communities-at-sea in fishing data when datasets are large (Chollett et al, in review).</p>
                    <p>All maps were aggregated at the “community” level, and represent the collective grounds of all fishers for that County. To protect data confidentiality, only communities consisting of more than three vessels were mapped.</p>
