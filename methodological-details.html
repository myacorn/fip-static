                    <p>The Fisheries Information Platform (FIP) contains non-confidential data of fishing landings
                        and revenues for shrimp, reef fish, highly migratory species and headboat fisheries in the
                        Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Data are provided as total or summarized by time period, species or
                        GoM State.</p>
                    <p>Below we provide a brief description of the data available for each fishery, and give an
                        overview of how we dealt with data confidentiality.</p>

                        <p class="opened-for-codepen">Shrimp fisheries data were derived from electronic logbooks and
                            dealer records for the period 2014-2021. Landings and revenues are reported per trip and
                            were matched to multiple VMS fishing pings. Fishing pings were identified using speed
                            filters and logic rules. Dealer records provide trip-level landings. Landings and revenues
                            for each electronic logbook ping were calculated by distributing trip-level values uniformly
                            to each fishing ping, the most common method used in marine spatial planning (Chollett et
                            al. 2022). Unmatched revenues and landings (corresponding to fishing activity carried out
                            by vessels without transponders, or when transponders were off) were distributed evenly
                            among fishing pings for that year. All revenue data were reported in 2021 dollars using the
                            implicit price deflator by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Full information for this
                            dataset can be found in Chollett &amp; O’Farrell (2022). Shrimp fisheries data were mapped
                            over a 10x10 km grid and over Coastal Fisheries statistical areas (Atkinson et al. 2021).

                            fisheries</a>
                        <p>Reef fish fisheries data are available from 2007 to 2021. In the GoM
                            reef fish are fished using multiple gears: bottom longline, handlines and bandit reels,
                            diving, buoys, gillnets, trolling, cast nets and traps. Only bottom longline, handlines and
                            bandit reels have been mapped at high spatial resolution using Vessel Monitoring System
                            (VMS) data that have been linked to logbooks. Spatial information for the other fisheries is
                            only available at the spatial scale of Coastal Fisheries statistical areas (Atkinson et al.
                            2021), through self-reported fishing locations in logbooks.</p>
                        <p>Data for reef fish fisheries using bottom longlines, handlines and bandit reels were
                            mapped in the FIP using VMS positions that have been linked to logbook data to extract
                            landings and revenues. Fishing pings were identified using a supervised classification
                            method implemented in Random Forests (Breiman 2001). Landings and revenues are
                            reported per trip and were matched to multiple VMS fishing pings. Landings and revenues
                            for each VMS ping were calculated by distributing trip-level values uniformly to each
                            fishing ping. Unmatched revenues and landings were distributed evenly among fishing
                            pings for that year. All revenue data were reported in 2021 dollars using the implicit price
                            deflator by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. This dataset was first described by
                            O’Farrell et al. (2017) and is fully described in O’Farrell et al. (in press). Bottom
                            longline,
                            handline and bandit reel reef fish fisheries data were mapped over a 10 x10 km grid and
                            over Coastal Fisheries statistical areas (Atkinson et al. 2021).</p>
                        <p>Data for reef fish fisheries without linked positional data (caught using diving, buoys,
                            gillnets and trolling) were mapped in the FIP using the self-reported Coastal Fisheries
                            statistical areas available in the logbooks (Atkinson et al. 2021). Revenues have been
                            adjusted to 2021 dollars using the implicit price deflator by the U.S. Bureau of Economic
                            Analysis. Coastal Cast nets and Traps are small fisheries with little fishing effort, have
                            no
                            non-confidential data at the statistical fishing area level if we apply the rule of three
                            and
                            were not mapped.</p>

                            species fisheries</a>
                        <p>Highly migratory species (HMS) are fished using
                            multiple gears: pelagic longline, bandit, bottom longline, buoys, gillnet, green stick tuna,
                            handlines, ottertrawl, pairtrawl, and rod and reel, but pelagic longline is by far the
                            largest
                            fishery in the GoM, accumulating almost 90% of logbook records from 2013 to 2021.</p>
                        <p>HMS fisheries data caught using pelagic longlines are available in the FIP from 2015 to
                            2021, when revenues data are available. Total revenue estimates were calculated by
                            George Silva (NOAA’s NMFS), and are not available for specific species or species
                            groups. For this dataset, landings and revenues are reported per set and coincide with a
                            self-reported coordinate. We summarized total landings and revenues data into Coastal
                            Fisheries statistical areas (Atkinson et al. 2021). Revenues have been adjusted to 2021
                            dollars using the implicit price deflator by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Although
                            this fishery has been recently mapped using high-spatial resolution VMS data, the data for
                            the fishery in the GoM is too sparse and 10 x10 km grids would involve loosing about half
                            of the data and were not considered here.</p>

                        <a href="#four" id="four"><img src="images/section3_off.png" class="icon" />Headboat
                            fisheries</a>
                        <p>In the Gulf, information for headboats targeting reef fish is available
                            from 2015 to 2021. In headboats recreational fishers carry more than six passengers for
                            half or full day trips and fishers pay by the “head” (Fitzpatrick et al. 2017). Data have
                            been
                            collected in the Gulf by the Beaufort Laboratory of the National Marine Fisheries Service,
                            Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SFSC) since 1986, with an electronic logbook
                            system since 2013 and economic data added in 2014 (Carter and Liese 2017, Fitzpatrick
                            et al. 2017). For each trip, logbooks collect information on date and duration of the trip,
                            geographic location of fishing activity, number of individuals of each caught species that
                            were kept, the number of crew, number of non-fishing passengers, gallons of fuel used
                            and price paid per gallon of fuel, among others (Fitzpatrick et al. 2017). For this fishery,
                            only data on location, date and net revenue pr trip were provided, and therefore there are
                            no associated landings, species or port information.</p>
                        <p>Revenue was estimated by NOAA’s SFSC (Social Science Research Group, Recreational
                            Fisheries) as the price per angler hour multiplied by the number of anglers and trip hours.
                            Net revenue was estimated as the revenue obtained minus fuel and crew costs, with fuel
                            costs equalling gallons used multiplied by the price per gallon, and crew costs calculated
                            as trip duration multiplied by wage per hour and number of crew. All information was
                            extracted from logbooks except the price per angler hour and wage which were estimated
                            from additional documentation<sup>1</sup></p>
                        <p>In the FIP all revenue data were reported in 2021 dollars using the implicit price deflator
                            by
                            the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Headboat fisheries data were mapped over a 10
                            x10 km grid and over Coastal Fisheries statistical areas (Atkinson et al. 2021).</p>

                            issues</a>
                        <p>US fisheries data are subject to strict confidentiality. To protect the identity of any
                            single
                            fisher, data presented to the public should conform a criteria called “rule of three”, where
                            locations with less than three different vessels fishing are excluded (filtered) from the
                            final
                            dataset. In all products in the FIP, records that did not meet the rule of three (&lt;=
                            three
                            unique vessels targeting a grid cell) were removed, therefore all the layers include only
                            non-confidential data.</p>
                        <p>Applying the rule of three implies loosing some information (Figure 1). The consequences
                            are likely to depend on the specific fishery or data subset. In general, the higher the
                            density of the data the less data loss. We quantified the percentage of data removed due
                            to applying the rule of three in each layer included in the FIP. All values can be found in
                            the
                            tables at the end of this document.</p>
                        <p>Figure 1. In the figure, a grid overlays hypothetical fishing pings. Fishing pings have
                            different colors to represent different vessels. The same set of pings is shown in each
                            panel. When producing a grid and applying the rule of three, some cells and fishing pings
                            are lost (right). For this hypothetical dataset, 11% of the pings are lost due to the rule
                            of
                            three.</p>
